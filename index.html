            <p>
              I'm a passionate singer and acoustic guitar player based in
              Vancouver. Music has been the heartbeat of my life for as long as
              I can remember, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              My performances are heartfelt journeys through my diverse
              repertoire of genres, including r&b, pop, and more. Whether I'm
              playing at intimate venues or private events, my goal is to create
              a memorable and immersive musical experience for every listener.

              Beyond live performances, I'm dedicated to songwriting. Crafting
              original pieces that reflect my life and the world around me.
              Music is not just an art form for me; it's a way to connect with
              others and bring joy and inspiration to their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              With my diploma in Music Therapy, I have the ability to connect
              people mentally and physically to their goals and emotions through
              music.

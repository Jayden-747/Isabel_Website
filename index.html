              I'm a passionate singer and acoustic guitar player based in
              Vancouver. Music has been the heartbeat of my life for as long as
              I can remember, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              My performances are heartfelt journeys through my diverse
              repertoire of genres, including r&b, pop, and more. Whether I'm
              playing at intimate venues or private events, my goal is to create
              a memorable and immersive musical experience for every listener.

            <p>
              Beyond live performances, I'm dedicated to songwriting. Crafting
              original pieces that reflect my life and the world around me.
              Music is not just an art form for me; it's a way to connect with
              others and bring joy and inspiration to their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              With my diploma in Music Therapy, I have the ability to connect
              people mentally and physically to their goals and emotions through
              music.
